# About The Project
Venture Funding with Deep Learning

This is a machine learning model that will predicts whether applicant will be successful if funded by Venture Capital firm.

### Built With

* Python
* Python CSV Reading/Writing
* Python pandas
* Python conda
* Python JupyterLab
* Python Tensorflow
* python scikit-learn

### Installation Guide
Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

* Install Python
* Install Panda
* pip install Panda
* Install JupterLabs
* pip install jupyter
* pip install Tensorflow
* pip install scikit-learn

Usage

The CSV used containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from The VC over the years. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, using the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

* The steps are broken out into the following sections:

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

* Optimize the neural network model.
